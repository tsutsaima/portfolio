Many of these projects are using my native language -Slovak- for variables due to the younger me not being used to using English as much as I do now. Also the names of some projects are in Slovak, because I don't think of these projects as that important.

These projects show my first steps in using WebClient/HttpClient, Objected Oriented Programming, Classes, Methods, or I just thought it looks cool.
