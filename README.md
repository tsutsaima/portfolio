This repository is a collection of projects I have built. It includes games, software, and experimental projects created at different points of my learning.

Some of these are old, some are new and are not only a showcase of what I can build now, but also a record of how I learned through curiosity, experimentation, and persistence. They show where I started and how far I’ve come.

These projects are testament to my interest in programming and developing things from scratch, while still broadening my horizons in the world of programming.
