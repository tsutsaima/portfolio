This repository is a collection of projects I have built. It includes games, software, and experimental projects created at different points of my learning.

Some of these are old, some are new and are not only a showcase of what I can build now, but also a record of how I learned through curiosity, experimentation, and persistence. They show where I started and how far I’ve come.

These projects are testament to my interest in programming and developing things from scratch, while still broadening my horizons in the world of programming.

I have divided them into projects that I'm proud of and all the other projects. It is missing projects across a few years, but sadly I wasn't able to recover from my unfunctional old laptop and those, that I wasn't able to find on USBs.
