!!!WARNING!!!
This program simulates key presses and cursor movements!

I made this program to AFK farm on a Minecraft server I loved to play on. It's name is also misspelled, because younger me thought that simulations (simulacie) is spelled: stimulations (stimulacie). You can try it out by opening notepad and letting it type.
